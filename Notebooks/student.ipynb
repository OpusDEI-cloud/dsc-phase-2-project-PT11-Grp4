    "# Business Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Context\n",
    "In today's dynamic entertainment landscape, major companies are increasingly investing in original video content. Our company, recognizing this significant market trend and the potential for substantial returns, has made a strategic decision to establish its own new movie studio. This venture represents a substantial investment and a new frontier for our organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, entering the highly competitive and often unpredictable film industry requires a deep understanding of its intricacies. We currently lack specialized knowledge in movie production, particularly concerning what drives box office success. This project is a crucial first step in bridging that knowledge gap. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to lay a solid foundation for the studio's initial strategy, mitigating risks and maximizing the potential for profitable film ventures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to provide the head of our new movie studio with clear, actionable guidance based on empirical evidence, enabling them to make informed decisions about the types of films to greenlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Business Questions\n",
    "To address the overarching business problem, our exploratory data analysis will seek to answer the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What genres of films consistently achieve the highest box office revenues?\n",
    "  - Are there specific sub-genres within these broad categories that perform     exceptionally well?\n",
    "  - Do certain genres show more consistent performance than others?\n",
    "- How does a film's production budget correlate with its box office performance?\n",
    "  - Is there an optimal budget range for maximizing profitability?\n",
    "  - Do \"blockbuster\" films (high budget) inherently carry less risk or guarantee higher returns?\n",
    "  - Can low-budget films achieve significant returns on investment (ROI)?\n",
    "- What role do critical reception and audience sentiment play in a film's box office success?\n",
    "  - Does a high critic score (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes) or audience score (e.g., IMDb user rating) directly translate to higher gross revenue?\n",
    "  - How quickly do reviews impact a film's performance after release?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Expected Deliverables\n",
    "The successful completion of this project will result in the following key deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report:**  \n",
    "  A detailed report (or Jupyter Notebook, as structured previously) outlining the data understanding, cleaning, and analysis process. This will include:\n",
    "  - Description of the datasets used and their integration.\n",
    "  - Key statistical summaries and distributions of relevant variables.\n",
    "  - Methodology for identifying trends and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impactful Visualizations:**  \n",
    "  A curated selection of clear, well-formatted charts and graphs that visually represent the most significant findings from the EDA. These visuals will be designed for a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Three Concrete Business Recommendations:**  \n",
    "  The cornerstone of this project. These will be explicit, actionable suggestions for the new movie studio, directly derived from the data analysis and tailored to address the core business problem. Each recommendation will be supported by clear insights and data evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concise Presentation/Storyline:**  \n",
    "  A narrative flow that guides the audience through the project, highlighting the most important discoveries and their implications for the studio's strategy. This will serve as the framework for communicating our findings effectively.\n"

    "# Data Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"Data Understanding\"** phase is the foundational step in any data analysis project. Its primary purpose is to observe and familiarize ourselves with the raw state of our datasets, identifying their inherent structure, content, and initial characteristics. This phase is purely about inspection and comprehension, setting the groundwork for all subsequent steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The core objectives of this phase are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assess Data Presence:** Confirm what data is available and how it's organized across files and tables.\n",
    "- **Understand Data Structure:** Grasp the dimensions (rows, columns), column names, and the inferred data types for each variable.\n",
    "- **Initial Content Familiarization:** Get a preliminary sense of the values and patterns present within the data.\n",
    "- **Identify Completeness:** Note the presence and extent of any missing data points.\n",
    "- **Detect Duplicates:** Pinpoint any identical rows within the datasets.\n",
    "- **Review Value Ranges:** Observe the spread and distribution of numerical and categorical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Observe and Understand the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of our six datasets (or relevant tables loaded from the IMDb database), we will systematically perform the following observational steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Loading Confirmation\n",
    "- Verify that all `.csv`, `.tsv`, and relevant `.db` tables have been successfully loaded into Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "- Confirm which specific tables from the SQLite database (`im.db`) are accessible and available for inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Structural Overview (`.info()`)\n",
    "- `df.info()`: Obtain a concise summary of the DataFrame structure, including:\n",
    "  - Total number of entries (rows)\n",
    "  - Total number of columns\n",
    "  - Column names\n",
    "  - Count of non-null values per column\n",
    "  - Inferred data types (e.g., `int64`, `float64`, `object`, `datetime64`)\n",
    "  - Memory usage of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Initial Data Snapshot (`.head()`)\n",
    "- `df.head()`: Display the first few rows of each DataFrame to get an immediate overview of the column names and data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Statistical Summary (`.describe()`)\n",
    "- `df.describe()`: Generate descriptive statistics for all numerical columns, including:\n",
    "  - `count`: Number of non-null observations\n",
    "  - `mean`: Average value\n",
    "  - `std`: Standard deviation\n",
    "  - `min`, `max`: Minimum and maximum values\n",
    "  - `25%`, `50%` (median), `75%`: Quartiles\n",
    "- For non-numerical columns:\n",
    "  - `df.describe(include='object')`: Show count of unique values, most frequent value (top), and its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Identify Missing Values (`.isnull().sum()`)\n",
    "- `df.isnull().sum()`: Calculate and display the total count of missing (null or NaN) values for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Identify Duplicate Entries (`.duplicated().sum()`)\n",
    "- `df.duplicated().sum()`: Count the number of rows that are exact duplicates of others within the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Explore Unique Values and Categorical Distribution\n",
    "- `df['column_name'].unique()`: List all distinct values in a specified column.\n",
    "- `df['column_name'].nunique()`: Count the number of unique values in a column.\n",
    "- `df['column_name'].value_counts()`: Show the frequency of each unique value, ordered from most to least frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Review Data Types\n",
    "- Examine the data types inferred by Pandas (via `.info()`).\n",
    "- Identify any columns with incorrect or inconsistent data types (e.g., numerical values stored as strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes from Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing these observational steps, we will have:\n",
    "- A clear and comprehensive overview of the content and structure of each dataset.\n",
    "- An understanding of the completeness of data within each column, highlighting any missing values.\n",
    "- Knowledge of the extent of duplicate records in the datasets.\n",
    "- A preliminary sense of the distributions, ranges, and patterns for both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- A solid foundation of knowledge about the raw state of the data, essential for moving forward to data preparation and subsequent analysis.\n"

      "|    1 | This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City's dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier's right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye's suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film's high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film's grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy's real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later. | R        | Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama | William Friedkin | Ernest Tidyman                  | Oct 9, 1971    | Sep 25, 2001 | nan        | nan          | 104 minutes | nan               |\n",

As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey.

      "|    5 | Illeana Douglas delivers a superb performance as Denise Waverly, a fictional singer and songwriter whose life bears more than a passing resemblance to that of real-life pop star Carole King. Edna Buxton, the daughter of a Philadelphia steel tycoon, aspires to a career as a singer, and when against her mother's bidding she sings a sultry version of \"Hey There (You With the Stars in Your Eyes)\" (instead of Mom's choice, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") at a talent contest, she wins a recording contact and moves to New York City. She cuts a record and gains a new stage name, Denise Waverly; however, she soon finds that girl singers are a dime a dozen in the Big Apple and her career as a vocalist goes nowhere. But she has a knack for writing songs, and eccentric producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) asks her to pen some songs for his upcoming projects. Teamed with Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz), a hipster songwriter who wants to express his political and social ideals through pop tunes, she finds both a successful collaborator and husband. While her work with Howard gains Denise writing credits on a string of hit records and respect within the industry, their marriage falls apart, and she becomes involved with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), the gifted but unstable leader of a popular West Coast surf music combo. Students of pop music history will have a ball with the various characters modeled after real-life rock legends, and the 1960s-style song score includes numbers written by Joni Mitchell and J. Mascis (of the band Dinosaur Jr.), as well as one-time King collaborator Gerry Goffin; a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach, \"God Give Me Strength,\" led to a full album written by the two great tunesmiths.                                                                                      | R        | Drama|Musical and Performing Arts   | Allison Anders   | Allison Anders                  | Sep 13, 1996   | Apr 18, 2000 | nan        | nan          | 116 minutes | nan               |\n",

DigiCom is about to launch a new virtual reality-based data storage system that is expected to revolutionize the industry, and Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland), the owner of the company, is in the midst of negotiating a merger that could bring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | R        | Drama|Mystery and Suspense          | Barry Levinson   | Paul Attanasio|Michael Crichton | Dec 9, 1994    | Aug 27, 1997 | nan        | nan          | 128 minutes | nan               |\n",

    "# Conclusive Summary: Step 3 - Data head Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Having examined the `head()` of each dataset, we gain further insights into their structure and content consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistency in Data Types and Formats:\n",
    "- Across all datasets, the data types and formatting observed in the `head()` generally remain consistent. This suggests that the issues identified (e.g., currency symbols in numeric columns, various date formats, string-based genre lists) are prevalent throughout the datasets, not just at the beginning.\n",
    "- For `bom_gross_df` and `tn_budgets_df`, the gross and budget figures continue to appear as strings requiring cleaning across all sampled rows.\n",
    "- Date columns (`release_date`, `theater_date`, `dvd_date`) consistently appear as strings in various formats, confirming the need for uniform date conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Confirmation of Missing Values:\n",
    "- The `head() views sometimes reveal `NaN` values or empty strings in columns where missing data was initially suspected from the `info()` or `head()` (e.g., `runtime_minutes` in `imdb_movie_basics_df`, `box_office` in `rt_movie_info_df`, `rating` in `rt_reviews_df`). This reinforces the importance of handling missing values systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diversity of Entries:\n",
    "- The `head()` method effectively demonstrates the diversity of entries within each dataset. For instance, in `rt_reviews_df`, we see varied review texts and rating formats (e.g., \"3/5\", \"B\", \"Fresh\") appearing randomly, confirming the need for standardization if we were to analyze review sentiment or convert ratings to a numeric scale.\n",
    "- Similarly, the `head()` for `imdb_movie_basics_df` and `tmdb_movies_df` shows a broader range of titles and associated metadata than just the initial top few entries, ensuring our understanding isn't skewed by a small subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications for Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistent observations from `head()`collectively affirm that our primary data preparation tasks will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardizing numerical columns:** Removing non-numeric characters (like '$', ',') and converting to appropriate numeric types (e.g., `float`, `int`).\n",
    "2. **Converting date columns:** Parsing various string date formats into standardized datetime objects.\n",
    "3. **Handling missing values:** Deciding on strategies for imputation or removal based on the extent and nature of missingness.\n",
    "4. **Parsing multi-value columns:** Addressing columns like `genres` or `genre_ids` which contain multiple values in a single string, requiring splitting for proper analysis.\n",
    "5. **Identifying and handling duplicates:** Ensuring unique records where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial visual inspection strongly supports the need for robust data cleaning and transformation before we can proceed with meaningful analysis."

    "\n",
    "### bom_gross_df (Box Office Mojo):\n",
    "- **domestic_gross**: Values range widely, with a max of $936.7M, showing highly skewed distribution (mean much higher than median). The count (3359) is slightly less than total rows, indicating some missing values in domestic_gross (or values that couldn't be parsed numerically).\n",
    "- **year** is consistent with movie release years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### imdb_movie_basics_df (IMDb Movie Basics):\n",
    "- **start_year**: Predominantly from 2010 onwards, but a max of 2115 indicates potential future or erroneous entries.\n",
    "- **runtime_minutes**: Has a large std and max of 51420 minutes (≈ 35 days), suggesting extreme outliers or incorrect units that need cleaning. Count (114405) is significantly less than total rows (146144), confirming many missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### imdb_movie_ratings_df (IMDb Movie Ratings):\n",
    "- **averagerating**: Ranges from 1.0 to 10.0, with a mean around 6.3, which is typical for movie ratings.\n",
    "- **numvotes**: Highly skewed, with a max of 1.84 million, indicating a few highly popular movies. Count (73856) confirms fewer ratings entries than movie basics.\n",

    "\n",
    "### rt_reviews_df (Rotten Tomatoes Reviews):\n",
    "- **id**: Consistent with rt_movie_info_df ids.\n",
    "- **top_critic**: A binary (0/1) column, with a mean of 0.24, meaning about 24% of reviews are from top critics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### tmdb_movies_df (The Movie Database):\n",
    "- **Unnamed: 0**: Redundant index column, can be dropped.\n",
    "- **popularity, vote_average, vote_count**: All appear to be reasonable numerical ranges. Popularity has a wide range, vote_average is 0-10, vote_count is highly skewed.\n",

    "\n",
    "### bom_gross_df:\n",
    "- **title**: Almost unique (3386 unique out of 3387 count), but one title is duplicated.\n",
    "- **studio**: 257 unique studios, with \"IFC\" being the top studio.\n",
    "- **foreign_gross**: Still shows up as categorical with 1204 unique string values, confirming the need for cleaning (as expected).\n",

    "\n",
    "The `.describe()` method reinforced the need for extensive data cleaning and transformation. Numerical columns often contain values that are currently strings, requiring conversion. Outliers (like runtime_minutes max in IMDb) and skewed distributions are apparent, which will require careful handling during analysis. Categorical columns often contain multiple values per entry (e.g., genres) or inconsistent formats (e.g., review ratings), demanding parsing and standardization. This step has provided a detailed inventory of data characteristics and potential quality issues across all datasets."

    "## Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `bom_gross_df` (Box Office Mojo Movie Gross):\n",
    "- `foreign_gross` has a significant amount of missing data (39.86%). This indicates that foreign box office data is often unavailable for movies in this dataset.\n",
    "- `domestic_gross` and `studio` have very few missing values (less than 1%), which is manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `imdb_movie_basics_df` (IMDb Movie Basics):\n",
    "- `runtime_minutes` is missing for a substantial portion of entries (21.72%). This column will need careful consideration for imputation or exclusion if runtime is a key analysis variable.\n",
    "- `genres` also has missing values (3.70%), which is important given its relevance to our business problem.\n",
    "- `original_title` has a negligible amount of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `imdb_movie_ratings_df` (IMDb Movie Ratings):\n",
    "- **No missing values found.** This is excellent, as rating and vote count data appear complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_movie_info_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info):\n",
    "- This dataset has the most severe missingness, particularly in financial (`currency`, `box_office`) and studio information (both over 78% missing). These columns are largely unusable as-is for direct financial analysis.\n",
    "- `studio` also has high missingness (68.33%).\n",
    "- `writer`, `theater_date`, and `dvd_date` have a considerable amount of missing data (around 23-28%).\n",
    "- `director`, `synopsis`, `runtime`, `genre`, and `rating` have lower but still notable percentages of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_reviews_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Reviews):\n",
    "- `rating` is missing for a large portion of reviews (24.83%). This complicates direct use of numerical ratings.\n",
    "- `review` text is also missing for over 10% of entries.\n",
    "- `critic` and `publisher` have minor missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tmdb_movies_df` (The Movie Database Movies):\n",
    "- **No missing values found.** This dataset appears very clean in terms of completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tn_budgets_df` (The Numbers Movie Budgets):\n",
    "- **No missing values found.** This is excellent, as budget and gross figures (even if still strings) are present for all entries.\n",

    "\n",
    "The presence of significant missing data, especially in key columns like `box_office`, `foreign_gross`, `runtime_minutes`, and various `rt_movie_info` fields, highlights critical data preparation challenges. We will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide on appropriate strategies for handling missing values based on the degree of missingness and the column's importance to our analysis.\n",
    "- Prioritize datasets with more complete information for core metrics like budget and gross revenue (e.g., `tn_budgets_df`, which is complete for these).\n",
    "- Recognize that some columns with very high missing percentages may be less reliable or even unusable for direct quantitative analysis without substantial external data sourcing."

    "# Step 7 (Unique Values and Categorical Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully explored the unique values and distributions within the categorical and object-type columns of our datasets. This detailed inspection further solidifies our understanding of data content and confirms several data quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `bom_gross_df` (Box Office Mojo Movie Gross):\n",
    "- `studio`: Contains 257 unique studio names, but some are abbreviated (e.g., 'BV', 'Par.', 'Uni.'), indicating a need for standardization if we want to consolidate studios.\n",
    "- `year`: As expected, covers 9 unique years from 2010 to 2018, with 2015 and 2016 having the most entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `imdb_movie_basics_df` (IMDb Movie Basics):\n",
    "- `genres`: Shows 1085 unique combinations (e.g., 'Action,Crime,Drama', 'Comedy,Drama,Fantasy'). This strongly confirms that `genres` is a comma-separated string that will require splitting and one-hot encoding or similar processing for proper genre analysis. \"Documentary\" and \"Drama\" are the most frequent single genres.\n",
    "- `start_year`: Contains 19 unique years, primarily from 2010-2019, but notably includes future years like 2021-2027 and a clear outlier `2115`. This confirms a data quality issue for `start_year` that needs attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_movie_info_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info):\n",
    "- `rating`: Has 6 unique MPAA ratings ('R', 'NR', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'G', 'NC17') plus `nan`, indicating a fairly clean categorical column.\n",
    "- `genre`: Similar to IMDb, shows 299 unique combinations (e.g., 'Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama'), confirming pipe-separated genres that will need parsing.\n",
    "- `studio`: `200 unique` values, with varying spellings/formats (e.g., 'Warner Bros. Pictures', 'Warner Bros.'), similar to `bom_gross_df`, requiring standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_reviews_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Reviews):\n",
    "- `rating`: **Critically, this column has 186 unique string formats for ratings** (e.g., '3/5', 'C', '2/4', 'B-', '4/5', '8'). This is a major finding, as it indicates a complex parsing challenge to convert these into a consistent numerical scale for analysis.\n",
    "- `fresh`: Cleanly categorized into 'fresh' (33035) and 'rotten' (21397), which is a clear binary indicator of review sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tmdb_movies_df` (The Movie Database Movies):\n",
    "- `original_language`: `76 unique` languages, dominated by 'en' (English), as expected. This is a clean categorical column.\n",
    "- `genre_ids`: Shows 2477 unique string representations of lists of numerical IDs (e.g., '[12, 14, 10751]'), indicating that these are numeric genre codes within a string, requiring extraction and mapping to actual genre names (likely from a lookup table or other datasets). The `[99]` and `[]` values also suggest 'no genre' or 'unknown' categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tn_budgets_df` (The Numbers Movie Budgets):\n",
    "- `release_date`: Has 2418 unique string formats of dates. This confirms the need for robust date parsing into a datetime object for chronological analysis. Many popular release dates (like 'Dec 31, 2014') are common placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "This step has provided granular details about the content of our categorical and object-type columns. The most significant implications for data preparation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex Parsing Required:** The `genres` (IMDb, RT), `genre_ids` (TMDb), `rating` (RT reviews), and financial columns (various datasets) will need sophisticated parsing due to their multi-value, inconsistent string, or currency-formatted nature.\n",
    "- **Standardization Needs:** `studio` names across `bom_gross_df` and `rt_movie_info_df` will need to be standardized for consistency.\n",
    "- **Date Conversion is Essential:** All `release_date` and similar columns must be converted to datetime objects for any time-series analysis or proper merging.\n",
    "- **Outlier Handling:** The `start_year` outlier in IMDb (`2115`) needs to be addressed."

    "# Step 8 - Assess Data Types and Conversion Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will consolidate our observations from previous steps, particularly `.info()` and `.describe()`, to formally identify which columns require data type conversions. Many columns currently stored as generic `object` types (strings) need to be converted to numerical (integers, floats) or datetime types to enable proper calculations, filtering, and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on:\n",
    "- **Identifying `object` columns that should be numerical**: This primarily applies to financial columns (budget, gross) and ratings/vote counts that might have been loaded as strings due to special characters.\n",
    "- **Identifying `object` columns that should be datetime**: All date-related columns that are currently strings.\n",
    "- **Identifying numerical columns that might have outliers/errors**: E.g., `runtime_minutes` with extreme values, `start_year` with future dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is crucial for planning the detailed data cleaning and transformation required before we can perform any quantitative analysis or effective data merging."

    "# Step 8 (Data Types and Conversion Needs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This step successfully consolidated our observations regarding data types and confirmed the extensive need for conversions and cleaning across multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Confirmations and Specific Conversion Needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `bom_gross_df` (Box Office Mojo):\n",
    "- `domestic_gross` is correctly `float64`, which is good.\n",
    "- `foreign_gross` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string (with '$', ',') to `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `imdb_movie_basics_df` (IMDb Movie Basics):\n",
    "- `runtime_minutes` (float64): Confirmed presence of extreme outlier values (e.g., 51420 mins). This column needs outlier handling and potentially unit standardization.\n",
    "- `genres` (object): Confirmed need to split comma-separated strings into individual genres for analysis.\n",
    "- `start_year` (int64): Confirmed presence of future year outliers (e.g., 2115). These will need to be cleaned or filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `imdb_movie_ratings_df` (IMDb Movie Ratings):\n",
    "- **No major type conversions or issues identified.** All relevant columns (`averagerating`, `numvotes`) are already numeric, which is ideal for direct use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_movie_info_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Movie Info):\n",
    "- `box_office` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string (with '$', ',') to `float`.\n",
    "- `runtime` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string (with 'minutes') to numeric (int/float).\n",
    "- `theater_date` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "- `dvd_date` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "- `genre` (object): Confirmed need to split pipe-separated strings into individual genres for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rt_reviews_df` (Rotten Tomatoes Reviews):\n",
    "- `rating` (object): Confirmed as a major challenge. Requires complex parsing from various string formats (e.g., \"3/5\", \"B-\") to a consistent numerical scale.\n",
    "- `date` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tmdb_movies_df` (The Movie Database Movies):\n",
    "- `release_date` (object): Confirmed need to convert from string to `datetime` objects.\n",
    "- `genre_ids` (object): Confirmed as string representations of lists of IDs. Requires parsing and mapping to actual genre names (using a lookup or other dataset).\n",
    "- `Unnamed: 0` (int64): Confirmed as a redundant index column that can be dropped.\n",

    "## Overall Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed type assessment reinforces that data cleaning will be a significant phase of this project. A systematic approach will be necessary to handle currency strings, varied date formats, multi-valued genre columns, and specific outlier/error values to prepare the data for effective merging and analysis. Datasets like `imdb_movie_ratings_df` and `tmdb_movies_df` (aside from genre_ids and release_date) are relatively cleaner in terms of base data types, providing a good foundation for merging."

    "# Data Preparation (Cleaning): Transforming Raw Data into Usable Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Preparation phase is where we transform the raw, heterogeneous data we've inspected into a clean, unified, and analysis-ready format. Based on the findings from our Data Understanding phase, this will involve significant cleaning, standardization, and restructuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Identifying Key Columns for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into cleaning, it's crucial to identify the most relevant columns from each dataset that will contribute to answering our business questions about box office success, movie types, and audience/critical reception. These columns will be prioritized for cleaning and subsequent merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key columns identified across our datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movie Identification & Linking:\n",
    "- **bom_gross_df**: title, year\n",
    "- **imdb_movie_basics_df**: movie_id, primary_title, original_title, start_year\n",
    "- **imdb_movie_ratings_df**: movie_id\n",
    "- **rt_movie_info_df**: id, title (implied from context, assuming a title column will be needed for linking with other datasets), theater_date\n",
    "- **rt_reviews_df**: id\n",
    "- **tmdb_movies_df**: id, title, release_date\n",
    "- **tn_budgets_df**: id, movie, release_date\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Performance:\n",
    "- **bom_gross_df**: domestic_gross, foreign_gross\n",
    "- **rt_movie_info_df**: box_office\n",
    "- **tn_budgets_df**: production_budget, domestic_gross, worldwide_gross\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movie Characteristics (Genres, Runtime, Studio):\n",
    "- **imdb_movie_basics_df**: genres, runtime_minutes\n",
    "- **rt_movie_info_df**: genre, runtime, studio\n",
    "- **tmdb_movies_df**: genre_ids\n",
    "- **bom_gross_df**: studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical & Audience Reception:\n",
    "- **imdb_movie_ratings_df**: averagerating, numvotes\n",
    "- **rt_reviews_df**: rating, fresh\n",
    "- **tmdb_movies_df**: popularity, vote_average, vote_count\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Comprehensive Cleaning Steps Based on Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the detailed observations from Steps 2-8 of Data Understanding, the following cleaning and transformation steps are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.1: Handling Redundant Columns\n",
    "**Drop Unnamed: 0**: Remove the `Unnamed: 0` column from `tmdb_movies_df`, as it appears to be a redundant index column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.2: Cleaning and Converting Financial Columns\n",
    "The gross and budget figures are currently stored as object (string) types with currency symbols and commas. They must be converted to numerical (float) types for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bom_gross_df**:\n",
    "- Clean `foreign_gross`: Remove '$' and ',' then convert to float.\n",
    "- `domestic_gross` is already float64, which is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rt_movie_info_df**:\n",
    "- Clean `box_office`: Remove '$' and ',' then convert to float.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tn_budgets_df**:\n",
    "- Clean `production_budget`: Remove '$' and ',' then convert to float.\n",
    "- Clean `domestic_gross`: Remove '$' and ',' then convert to float.\n",
    "- Clean `worldwide_gross`: Remove '$' and ',' then convert to float.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.3: Cleaning and Converting Date Columns\n",
    "Date columns are in inconsistent string formats across datasets and need to be converted to datetime objects for consistent chronological analysis and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bom_gross_df**: The `year` column is already int64 and suitable as-is for year-based linking.\n",
    "- **imdb_movie_basics_df**: Handle `start_year` outlier: Correct or filter out the 2115 year, as it is an erroneous future date.\n",
    "- **rt_movie_info_df**: Convert `theater_date` to datetime. Convert `dvd_date` to datetime.\n",
    "- **rt_reviews_df**: Convert `date` to datetime.\n",
    "- **tmdb_movies_df**: Convert `release_date` to datetime.\n",
    "- **tn_budgets_df**: Convert `release_date` to datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.4: Cleaning and Processing Genre Columns\n",
    "Genre information is present in various formats (comma-separated, pipe-separated, ID lists) and requires parsing for consistent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**imdb_movie_basics_df (genres)**:\n",
    "- Split the comma-separated strings into lists of individual genres.\n",
    "- Handle NaN values for genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rt_movie_info_df (genre)**:\n",
    "- Split the pipe-separated strings (|) into lists of individual genres.\n",
    "- Handle NaN values for genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tmdb_movies_df (genre_ids)**:\n",
    "- Parse the string representation of lists (e.g., '[12, 14, 10751]') into actual Python lists of integers.\n",
    "- Map these numerical genre_ids to their corresponding human-readable genre names. This will likely require an external lookup or leveraging information from other datasets if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.5: Cleaning and Standardizing Runtime Columns\n",
    "**imdb_movie_basics_df (runtime_minutes)**:\n",
    "- Address extreme outliers (e.g., 51420 minutes). Values that are unrealistically high should either be corrected if possible (e.g., assuming a unit error) or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rt_movie_info_df (runtime)**:\n",
    "- Clean the string format (e.g., '90 minutes') by extracting the numerical part and converting to int or float.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.6: Parsing and Standardizing Rotten Tomatoes Review Ratings\n",
    "This is a complex cleaning task due to the highly varied string formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rt_reviews_df (rating)**:\n",
    "- Develop a robust function to parse various formats (e.g., '3/5', 'B-', '4/4', '8') into a consistent numerical scale (e.g., 0-10 or 0-1). This will likely involve conditional logic and regular expressions.\n",
    "- Handle NaN values in this column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.7: Handling Missing Values (General Strategy)\n",
    "Based on the Step 5 findings, we will implement a strategy for NaN values:\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Missingness** (e.g., rt_movie_info_df: currency, box_office, studio): For columns with very high percentages of missing data, direct imputation may not be reliable. We might choose to:\n",
    "- Use these columns only where data exists.\n",
    "- Exclude them from analyses where completeness is critical.\n",
    "- Attempt to infer or fill from other datasets during merging if a clear match can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderate Missingness** (e.g., bom_gross_df: foreign_gross, imdb_movie_basics_df: runtime_minutes, genres, rt_movie_info_df: writer, theater_date, dvd_date, director, rt_reviews_df: rating, review):\n",
    "- For numerical columns, consider imputation strategies (e.g., mean, median, or more sophisticated methods) if appropriate for the analysis.\n",
    "- For categorical/text columns, consider replacing with 'Unknown' or similar.\n",
    "- For date columns, dropping rows or using interpolation might be options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Missingness**: For columns with very few missing values, dropping the rows with NaN might be acceptable if it doesn't significantly reduce the dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.8: Removing Duplicate Rows\n",
    "**rt_reviews_df**: Remove the 9 identified duplicate rows to ensure uniqueness in review data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2.9: Standardizing Studio Names\n",
    "**bom_gross_df and rt_movie_info_df (studio)**:\n",
    "- Identify common studio names with different abbreviations or spellings.\n",
    "- Create a mapping or use string matching techniques to standardize these names to a single representation (e.g., \"Warner Bros. Pictures\" instead of \"WB\"). This is critical for consolidating financial data by studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive cleaning plan addresses the identified data quality issues and prepares the datasets for the next stage: Data Integration (Merging), which will combine these disparate sources into a cohesive analytical dataset."

      "|    1 | This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City's dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier's right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye's suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film's high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film's grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy's real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later. | R        | Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama | William Friedkin | Ernest Tidyman                  | Oct 9, 1971    | Sep 25, 2001 | nan        |          nan | 104 minutes | nan               |\n",
      "|    3 | New York City, not-too-distant-future: Eric Packer, a 28 year-old finance golden boy dreaming of living in a civilization ahead of this one, watches a dark shadow cast over the firmament of the Wall Street galaxy, of which he is the uncontested king. As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination. -- (C) Official Site                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | R        | Drama|Science Fiction and Fantasy   | David Cronenberg | David Cronenberg|Don DeLillo    | Aug 17, 2012   | Jan 1, 2013  | $          |       600000 | 108 minutes | Entertainment One |\n",
      "|    5 | Illeana Douglas delivers a superb performance as Denise Waverly, a fictional singer and songwriter whose life bears more than a passing resemblance to that of real-life pop star Carole King. Edna Buxton, the daughter of a Philadelphia steel tycoon, aspires to a career as a singer, and when against her mother's bidding she sings a sultry version of \"Hey There (You With the Stars in Your Eyes)\" (instead of Mom's choice, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") at a talent contest, she wins a recording contact and moves to New York City. She cuts a record and gains a new stage name, Denise Waverly; however, she soon finds that girl singers are a dime a dozen in the Big Apple and her career as a vocalist goes nowhere. But she has a knack for writing songs, and eccentric producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) asks her to pen some songs for his upcoming projects. Teamed with Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz), a hipster songwriter who wants to express his political and social ideals through pop tunes, she finds both a successful collaborator and husband. While her work with Howard gains Denise writing credits on a string of hit records and respect within the industry, their marriage falls apart, and she becomes involved with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), the gifted but unstable leader of a popular West Coast surf music combo. Students of pop music history will have a ball with the various characters modeled after real-life rock legends, and the 1960s-style song score includes numbers written by Joni Mitchell and J. Mascis (of the band Dinosaur Jr.), as well as one-time King collaborator Gerry Goffin; a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach, \"God Give Me Strength,\" led to a full album written by the two great tunesmiths.                                                                                      | R        | Drama|Musical and Performing Arts   | Allison Anders   | Allison Anders                  | Sep 13, 1996   | Apr 18, 2000 | nan        |          nan | 116 minutes | nan               |\n",

      "|    1 | This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City's dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier's right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye's suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film's high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film's grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy's real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later. | R        | Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama | William Friedkin | Ernest Tidyman                  | 1971-10-09 00:00:00 | 2001-09-25 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan | 104 minutes | nan               |\n",
      "|    3 | New York City, not-too-distant-future: Eric Packer, a 28 year-old finance golden boy dreaming of living in a civilization ahead of this one, watches a dark shadow cast over the firmament of the Wall Street galaxy, of which he is the uncontested king. As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination. -- (C) Official Site                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | R        | Drama|Science Fiction and Fantasy   | David Cronenberg | David Cronenberg|Don DeLillo    | 2012-08-17 00:00:00 | 2013-01-01 00:00:00 | $          |       600000 | 108 minutes | Entertainment One |\n",
      "|    5 | Illeana Douglas delivers a superb performance as Denise Waverly, a fictional singer and songwriter whose life bears more than a passing resemblance to that of real-life pop star Carole King. Edna Buxton, the daughter of a Philadelphia steel tycoon, aspires to a career as a singer, and when against her mother's bidding she sings a sultry version of \"Hey There (You With the Stars in Your Eyes)\" (instead of Mom's choice, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") at a talent contest, she wins a recording contact and moves to New York City. She cuts a record and gains a new stage name, Denise Waverly; however, she soon finds that girl singers are a dime a dozen in the Big Apple and her career as a vocalist goes nowhere. But she has a knack for writing songs, and eccentric producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) asks her to pen some songs for his upcoming projects. Teamed with Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz), a hipster songwriter who wants to express his political and social ideals through pop tunes, she finds both a successful collaborator and husband. While her work with Howard gains Denise writing credits on a string of hit records and respect within the industry, their marriage falls apart, and she becomes involved with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), the gifted but unstable leader of a popular West Coast surf music combo. Students of pop music history will have a ball with the various characters modeled after real-life rock legends, and the 1960s-style song score includes numbers written by Joni Mitchell and J. Mascis (of the band Dinosaur Jr.), as well as one-time King collaborator Gerry Goffin; a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach, \"God Give Me Strength,\" led to a full album written by the two great tunesmiths.                                                                                      | R        | Drama|Musical and Performing Arts   | Allison Anders   | Allison Anders                  | 1996-09-13 00:00:00 | 2000-04-18 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan | 116 minutes | nan               |\n",

    "- **`imdb_movie_basics_df`**: We successfully **corrected 2** `start_year` outliers (future dates) by setting them to `NaN`. The `start_year` column's Dtype is now `float64` to accommodate these `NaN` values. This ensures that only valid years are considered in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`rt_movie_info_df`**: Both `theater_date` and `dvd_date` columns have been successfully converted from `object` (string) to `datetime64[ns]`. This allows for direct date comparisons and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`rt_reviews_df`**: The `date` column has been successfully converted from `object` to `datetime64[ns]`, enabling time-based analysis of reviews.\n",

    "- **`tmdb_movies_df`**: The `release_date` column has been successfully converted from `object` to `datetime64[ns]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "With this step, all identified date-related columns are now in the standardized `datetime` format, and the `start_year` outlier has been addressed. This crucial transformation enables accurate time-series analysis, simplifies temporal filtering, and prepares our datasets for robust merging operations where dates serve as a linking mechanism."

      "|    1 | This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City's dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier's right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye's suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film's high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film's grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy's real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later. | R        | ['Action and Adventure', 'Classics', 'Drama'] | William Friedkin | Ernest Tidyman                  | 1971-10-09 00:00:00 | 2001-09-25 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan | 104 minutes | nan               |\n",
      "|    3 | New York City, not-too-distant-future: Eric Packer, a 28 year-old finance golden boy dreaming of living in a civilization ahead of this one, watches a dark shadow cast over the firmament of the Wall Street galaxy, of which he is the uncontested king. As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination. -- (C) Official Site                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | R        | ['Drama', 'Science Fiction and Fantasy']      | David Cronenberg | David Cronenberg|Don DeLillo    | 2012-08-17 00:00:00 | 2013-01-01 00:00:00 | $          |       600000 | 108 minutes | Entertainment One |\n",
      "|    5 | Illeana Douglas delivers a superb performance as Denise Waverly, a fictional singer and songwriter whose life bears more than a passing resemblance to that of real-life pop star Carole King. Edna Buxton, the daughter of a Philadelphia steel tycoon, aspires to a career as a singer, and when against her mother's bidding she sings a sultry version of \"Hey There (You With the Stars in Your Eyes)\" (instead of Mom's choice, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") at a talent contest, she wins a recording contact and moves to New York City. She cuts a record and gains a new stage name, Denise Waverly; however, she soon finds that girl singers are a dime a dozen in the Big Apple and her career as a vocalist goes nowhere. But she has a knack for writing songs, and eccentric producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) asks her to pen some songs for his upcoming projects. Teamed with Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz), a hipster songwriter who wants to express his political and social ideals through pop tunes, she finds both a successful collaborator and husband. While her work with Howard gains Denise writing credits on a string of hit records and respect within the industry, their marriage falls apart, and she becomes involved with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), the gifted but unstable leader of a popular West Coast surf music combo. Students of pop music history will have a ball with the various characters modeled after real-life rock legends, and the 1960s-style song score includes numbers written by Joni Mitchell and J. Mascis (of the band Dinosaur Jr.), as well as one-time King collaborator Gerry Goffin; a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach, \"God Give Me Strength,\" led to a full album written by the two great tunesmiths.                                                                                      | R        | ['Drama', 'Musical and Performing Arts']      | Allison Anders   | Allison Anders                  | 1996-09-13 00:00:00 | 2000-04-18 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan | 116 minutes | nan               |\n",

    "\n",

    "- **`rt_movie_info_df` (`genre`)**: Similarly, the pipe-separated genre strings have been successfully split into lists of individual genres. `NaN` values were also converted to empty lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`tmdb_movies_df` (`genre_ids`)**:\n",
    " - The string representations of genre ID lists (e.g., `'[12, 14]'`) were successfully parsed into actual Python lists of integers.\n",
    " - A new column, `genres_tmdb`, was created by mapping these numerical `genre_ids` to their corresponding human-readable names using a predefined dictionary. This provides a clear, interpretable genre list for TMDb movies.\n",

    "## Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "With these transformations, our genre data is now consistently structured as lists of strings, whether from direct parsing or ID mapping. This enables direct analysis of genre popularity, identification of multi-genre films, and facilitates future aggregation and one-hot encoding for modeling."

      "|    1 | This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City's dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier's right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye's suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film's high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film's grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy's real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later. | R        | ['Action and Adventure', 'Classics', 'Drama'] | William Friedkin | Ernest Tidyman                  | 1971-10-09 00:00:00 | 2001-09-25 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan |       104 | nan               |\n",

As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey.

Edna Buxton, the daughter of a Philadelphia steel tycoon, aspires to a career as a singer, and when against her mother's bidding she sings a sultry version of \"Hey There (You With the Stars in Your Eyes)\" (instead of Mom's choice, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\") at a talent contest, she wins a recording contact and moves to New York City. She cuts a record and gains a new stage name, Denise Waverly; however, she soon finds that girl singers are a dime a dozen in the Big Apple and her career as a vocalist goes nowhere. But she has a knack for writing songs, and eccentric producer Joel Milner (John Turturro) asks her to pen some songs for his upcoming projects. Teamed with Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz), a hipster songwriter who wants to express his political and social ideals through pop tunes, she finds both a successful collaborator and husband. While her work with Howard gains Denise writing credits on a string of hit records and respect within the industry, their marriage falls apart, and she becomes involved with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), the gifted but unstable leader of a popular West Coast surf music combo. Students of pop music history will have a ball with the various characters modeled after real-life rock legends, and the 1960s-style song score includes numbers written by Joni Mitchell and J. Mascis (of the band Dinosaur Jr.), as well as one-time King collaborator Gerry Goffin; a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach, \"God Give Me Strength,\" led to a full album written by the two great tunesmiths.                                                                                      | R        | ['Drama', 'Musical and Performing Arts']      | Allison Anders   | Allison Anders                  | 1996-09-13 00:00:00 | 2000-04-18 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan |       116 | nan               |\n",

DigiCom is about to launch a new virtual reality-based data storage system that is expected to revolutionize the industry, and Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland), the owner of the company, is in the midst of negotiating a merger that could bring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | R        | ['Drama', 'Mystery and Suspense']             | Barry Levinson   | Paul Attanasio|Michael Crichton | 1994-12-09 00:00:00 | 1997-08-27 00:00:00 | nan        |          nan |       128 | nan               |\n",

As observed, this column contains highly varied string formats (e.g., '3/5', 'C', '2/4', 'B-', '4/5', '8'). Our goal is to parse these diverse string representations into a **consistent numerical scale** (e.g., 0-10 or 0-1) that can be directly used for quantitative analysis of critical sentiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Out of 40,915 original non-null ratings, 40,903 were successfully converted, indicating a very high success rate in parsing complex string formats. The small discrepancy (12 values) likely comes from unparseable or unexpected string formats that were correctly converted to `NaN`.\n",

This standardization is fundamental for any analysis involving Rotten Tomatoes review scores and moves us closer to integrating this sentiment data with other movie attributes."

    "Now, let's tackle the core business questions one by one. For each question, we will identify the necessary data, conduct the analysis, create specific visualizations, and conclude with the key findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎬 Question 1: What genres are currently most profitable?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand genre profitability, we need to combine movie genre information with financial data. The most robust combination for this query will involve merging `imdb_movie_basics_df` (for comprehensive genre data) with `tn_budgets_df` (for production budgets and worldwide gross revenues).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merge Data:** Conduct an inner merge of `imdb_movie_basics_df` and `tn_budgets_df` on relevant movie identifiers (e.g., `movie_id` from IMDb and movie name with release_date from The Numbers, or a composite key)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Profitability:** For each movie, calculate:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   profit = worldwide_gross - production_budget\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Genres:** As genres are stored as lists (e.g., `['Action', 'Drama']`), we will *explode* these lists so that each movie-genre combination becomes a unique row\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Aggregate by Genre:** Group the data by individual genre and calculate:\n",
    "   - Median worldwide gross\n",
    "   - Median profit\n",
    "   > *Median is preferred over mean to reduce the impact of extreme outliers*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identify Top Genres:** Rank genres based on their median worldwide gross and median profit\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Analyze Trends *(Optional)*:** If sufficient data is available, analyze the profitability of top genres over recent years (e.g., last 3-5 years)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Question 2: What is the relationship between budget and box office revenue?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question primarily focuses on the `tn_budgets_df` dataset, which already contains both `production_budget` and `worldwide_gross`. Therefore, a complex merge might not be immediately necessary for this core analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Selection:** Use `tn_budgets_df` directly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between `production_budget` and `worldwide_gross`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Profit Calculation:** Calculate:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   profit = worldwide_gross - production_budget\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regression Analysis:** Potentially fit a simple linear regression model to predict worldwide gross based on production budget\n",

    "\n",
    "To address this, we need to bring together review scores and box office revenue. We will primarily leverage:\n",
    "- `imdb_movie_ratings_df` (for audience ratings)\n",
    "- `rt_reviews_df` (for critic sentiment using fresh status)\n",
    "- `tmdb_movies_df` (vote_average and vote_count for audience insights)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merge Data:**\n",
    "   - Merge `imdb_movie_ratings_df` with `tn_budgets_df` on `movie_id` and potentially `title/primary_title`\n",
    "   - Merge `rt_reviews_df` with `tn_budgets_df` on `id` and `title/movie`\n",
    "   - Consider merging `tmdb_movies_df` with `tn_budgets_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate correlation between rating scores and `worldwide_gross`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Categorical Impact:** Analyze the average `worldwide_gross` for movies categorized by **fresh** vs. **rotten**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hypothesis Testing *(Optional)*:** Perform a t-test to see if there's a statistically significant difference in box office performance\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Data Types Corrected:** All financial columns (`domestic_gross`, `foreign_gross`, `box_office`, `production_budget`, `worldwide_gross`) are now correctly `float64`. All identified date columns (`theater_date`, `dvd_date`, `date`, `release_date`) are now `datetime64[ns]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outliers Addressed:** Extreme `runtime_minutes` values in `imdb_movie_basics_df` and future `start_year` values in `imdb_movie_basics_df` have been converted to `NaN`, preventing distortion of statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Values Handled:** Missing values in numerical columns (`domestic_gross`, `foreign_gross`, `runtime_minutes`, `rating_numeric`) have been imputed with medians. Missing categorical/text values (`studio`, `original_title`, `director`, `writer`, `synopsis`, `review`, `critic`, `publisher`) have been filled with `'Unknown'` or appropriate placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genre & Runtime Processed:** Genre columns (`genres`, `genre`, `genre_ids`) are now consistently structured as lists of strings or mapped names, ready for analysis. Runtime in `rt_movie_info_df` is now numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redundancies & Duplicates Eliminated:** The `Unnamed: 0` column in `tmdb_movies_df` has been dropped, and duplicate rows in `rt_reviews_df` were not found during the final check *(indicating unique records after initial processing or successful previous removal)*.\n",
    "\n",
